Should create dir "libft" from 
https://github.com/fhideous/libft.git


Objective is to code the Pipex program.

It executed in this way:
* $> ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2

Just in case: file1 and file2 are file names, cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with
their parameters.

The execution of the pipex program should do the same as the next shell command:
* $> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
